## „ÄΩÔ∏èINTRODUCTION PART ONE:

### üîπOVERVIEW AND PURPOSE OF THIS GUIDE

Project management is not new. It has been in use for hundreds of years. Examples of project outcomes include:<br>

- Pyramids of Giza,
- Olympic games,
- Great Wall of China,
- Taj Mahal,
- Publication of a children's book,
- Panama Canal,
- Development of commercial jet airplanes,
- Polio vaccine,
- Human beings landing on the moon,
- Commercial software applications,
- Portable devices to use the global positioning system (GPS), and
- Placement of the International Space Station into Earth's orbit.

The outcomes of these projects were the result of leaders and managers applying project management practices, principles, processes, tools, and techniques to their work. The managers of these projects used a set of key skills and applied knowledge to satisfy their customers and other people involved in and affected by the project. By the mid-20th century, project managers began the work of seeking recognition for project management as a profession. One aspect of this work involved obtaining agreement on the content of the body of knowledge (BOK) called project management. This BOK became known as the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK). The Project Management Institute (PMI) produced a baseline of charts and glossaries for the PMBOK. Project managers soon realized that no single book could contain the entire PMBOK. Therefore, PMI developed
and published A <i>Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge</i> (PMBOK¬Æ Guide).<br>

PMI defines the project management body of knowledge (PMBOK) as a term that describes the knowledge within the profession of project management. The project management body of knowledge includes proven traditional practices that are widely applied as well as innovative practices that are emerging in the profession.<br>
The body of knowledge (BOK) includes both published and unpublished materials. This body of knowledge is constantly evolving. This <i>PMBOK¬Æ Guide</i> identifies a subset of the project management body of knowledge that is generally recognized as good practice.<br>

- <i>Generally recognized</i> means the knowledge and practices described are applicable to most projects most of the time, and there is consensus about their value and usefulness.

- <i>Good practice</i> means there is general agreement that the application of the knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project management processes can enhance the chance of success over many projects in delivering the expected business values and results.

The project manager works with the project team and other stakeholders to determine and use the appropriate generally recognized good practices for each project. Determining the appropriate combination of processes, inputs, tools, techniques, outputs and life cycle phases to manage a project is referred to as ‚Äútailoring‚Äù the application of the knowledge described in this guide.<br>

This <i>PMBOK¬Æ Guide</i> is different from a methodology. A methodology is a system of practices, techniques, procedures, and rules used by those who work in a discipline. This <i>PMBOK¬Æ Guide</i> is a foundation upon which organizations can build methodologies, policies, procedures, rules, tools and techniques, and life cycle phases needed to practice project management.<br>


## „ÄΩÔ∏èINTRODUCTION PART TWO:

A standard is a document established by an authority, custom, or general consent as a model or example. This standard was developed using a process based on the concepts of consensus, openness, due process, and balance. This standard describes the processes considered to be good practice on most projects most of the time. These processes are organized by Process Group. It further defines key project management concepts including the relationship of project management to organizational strategy and objectives, governance, portfolio management, program management, the project environment, and project success. It also covers information on project life cycles, project stakeholders, and the role of the project manager. Section 1 discusses key concepts and provides contextual information about project management. Sections 2 through 6 provide definitions for each of the five Process Groups and describe the processes within those Process Groups. Sections 2 through 6 also describe the key benefits, inputs, and outputs for each project management process. This standard serves as the foundation and framework for <i>A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK¬Æ Guide). PMBOK¬Æ Guide</i> expands on
the information in this standard by providing a more in-depth description of the context, environment and influences on project management. In addition, the <i>PMBOK¬Æ Guide</i> provides descriptions of the project management process inputs and outputs, identifies tools and techniques, and discusses key concepts and emerging trends associated with each Knowledge Area.
